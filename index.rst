The Gloss Project
=========================================

Gloss is a new web design process, primarily aimed at creating happy design teams. 

We're working to ensure that Gloss allows you to stay focused
on visual and interaction design. To this end we will introduce features that help this goal and remove features
antagonistic to this goal.

If you're interested in building complex (and not so complex) content driven sites in less time, Gloss may be a
good fit. If you have an opinionated team that think they've figured it all out and everything is working for you already, then
there's nothing to see here, just move on.

The Gloss Project
=========================================

Gloss is a new web design process, primarily aimed at creating happy design teams. 
If you're interested in building content driven sites in less time, Gloss may be a
good fit. If you have an opinionated team that think they've figured it all out then
there's nothing to see here, just move on.

Gloss in a Nutshell
---------------------

Gloss relies on a technique called "Content Assignment", this makes it possible for a designer to 
assign headers, footers, menus and other components to elements of a template, simply by assigning special
classes to elements of their template.

Layout and Content Assignment
--------------------------------

The general workflow roughly looks like this:

1. Start with a well structured html layout (preferably responsive).

2. Add the special gl classes

3. Publish

As much as possible Gloss does the rest for you. We push Gloss to it's limits, so that
you can stay focused on design.

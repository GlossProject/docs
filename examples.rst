Content Drop Examples
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Adding Custom CSS 
------------------------
Some times there is a need to override styles in place. It is always recommended that this be done within your HTML layout
however there are sometimes mitigating circumstances that prevent this. When faced with the need to quickly add CSS
you can make use of Gloss's `custom-css.xml` file.

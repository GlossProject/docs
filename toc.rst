Table of Contents
=========================================

Gloss is a new web design process, primarily aimed at creating happy design teams. 
If you're interested in building content driven sites in less time, Gloss may be a
good fit. If you have an opinionated team that think they've figured it all out then
there's nothing to see here, just move on.
